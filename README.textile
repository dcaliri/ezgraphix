h3. Installation Notes

h4. As a plugin.

Install the plugin:

script/plugin install git://github.com/jpemberthy/ezgraphix.git

Run the tasks: (it will move the necessary files to use the plugin)

rake ezgrahpix:setup (from your project's root.)

After the installation include the FusionCharts.js in each layout that will render ezgraphix:

<%= javascript_include_tag "FusionCharts" %>

that's it!.

h4. As a Gem.

Will add gem support soon!

h3. Usage

(this is the basic usage, I will create a blog entry with a more detailed information also rdoc will be published)

h4.In your Controller:

def index

  @g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new
  @g.data = {:ruby => 1, :perl => 2, :smalltalk => 3}

end

There are 2 ways passing render options:

1) when the Graphic object is created, you can define it also as: 

@g = Ezgraphix::Graphic.new(:w => 200, :h => 300, :c_type => 'bar3d', :div_name => 'my_chart_tag_name')

defaults are: {:c_type => 'col3d', :w => 300, :h => 300, :div_name => 'basic_graph'}
At the moment, you can render the following graphics:

Column 3D => :c_type => 'col3d'
Bar 2D => :c_type => 'bar2d'
Column 2D => :c_type => 'col2d'

2) Anytime you want accessing the render_options attributes.

@g.render_options(:caption => 'cool languages')

h4. In your view.

Add the following line whenever you want to render the graphic.

<%= render_ezgraphix @g %>

h4. note.

Full set of render_options will be specified in the rdoc, and more chart's support will be included soon!.
